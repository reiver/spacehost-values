## Customers

We care about customers.

We want to do things within reason to try to make the customer satisfied with our products and services, while at the same time not making other customers unsatisfied.
We hope to do such a good job that many of our customers become fans of us and what we do.

**№1:**

To do this effectively, we need to understand the customers.
To do this we need to understand the industries, cultures, and environments which the customers are embedded in, on an ongoing basis, updating our understanding as we gain new information and things change.
To do this we need to share this understanding.
To do this effectively we need to share this understanding in a format that makes accurately communicating it easier.

**№2:**

To do this effectively, we need feedback and other communications from the customer to be shared across the company (in a privacy repecting way).
Everyone in the company should _feel-the-pain_ (and feel-the-joy) of the customer.
If enough customers have the same pain, we should conisder addressing it a product & services level.

## Privacy

We care about privacy.



---

## Fediverse

We care about the Fediverse.

For the Fediverse to last in the long-term it must be economically viable for those who make it exist — the people who create the software, the people who operate the servers, etc.

We will do what we can reasonably do to support them.
Including supporting them financially.

## Effectiveness

We care about effectiveness.

Get stuff done.

Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

If items have priorities associateed with them, then do them in priority order.

---

## Reliability

We care about reliability.

---

## Accountability

We care about accountability.

Making decisions makes you accountable.

Certain roles are required to always be accountable for certain things.
Even if these roles delegate or defer to others, they are still accountable for anything done by whomever they delegated or deferred to.

Whomever would have gotten credit for something succeeding is the same person who gets blamed for its failure.

## Politics

Humans are political creatures.
Politics are normal.

But your politics may _not_ be (and likely isn't) shared with all others.

It doesn't matter whether you call your _politics_ "morals", "ideology", "ethics", "politics", or whatever.
It is all still _politics_ as far as this is concerned.

If you discover that someone is _not_ receptive to your politics, stop sharing it with them.

Don't make the workplace unnecessarily political.

People should be able to work and do their job without being exposed to politics they aren't receptive to.

## Customers

## Privacy

We care about privacy.

---

## Fediverse

We care about the Fediverse.

For the Fedivetse to last in the long-term it must be economically viable for those who make it exist — the people who create the software, the people who operate the servers, etc.

We will do what we can reasonably do to support them.
Including supporting them financially.

## Effectiveness

We care about effectiveness.

---

## Reliability

We care about reliability.

---

## Accountability

We care about accountability.

Making decisions makes you accountable.

Certain roles are required to always be accountable.
Even if these roles delegate or defer to others, they are still accountable for anything done by whomever they delegated or deferred to.

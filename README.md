## Customers

We care about the customer.

---

## Privacy

We care about privacy.

---

## Fediverse

We care about the Fediverse.

For the Fediverse to last in the long-term it must be economically viable for those who make it exist — the people who create the software, the people who operate the servers, etc.

We will do what we can reasonably do to support them.
Including supporting them financially.

---

## Effectiveness

We care about effectiveness.

Get stuff done.

Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

---

## Reliability

We care about reliability.

---

## Accountability

We care about accountability.

Making decisions makes you accountable.

Certain roles are required to always be accountable for certain things.
Even if these roles delegate or defer to others, they are still accountable for anything done by whomever they delegated or deferred to.

Whomever would have gotten credit for something succeeding is the same person who gets blamed for its failure.

## Politics

Humans are political creatures.
Politics are normal.

But your politics may _not_ be shared with others.

It doesn't matter whether you call your _politics_ "morals", "ideology", "ethics", or "politics".
It is all still _politics_ as far as this is concerned.

If you discover that someone is _not_ receptive to your politics, stop sharing it with them.

Don't make the workplace unnecessarily political.
